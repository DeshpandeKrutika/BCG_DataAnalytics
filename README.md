### Week 1 Task:

### Week 2 Task:

The BCG project team thinks that building a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. The client has sent over some data and the AD wants you to perform some exploratory data analysis.

The data that was sent over includes:

* Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign-up date, forecasted usage etc
* Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
* Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not
  
Sub-Task 1:
Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions. This first subtask is for you to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset. You should spend around 1 hour on this.

Sub-Task 2:
Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn. It is up to you to define price sensitivity and calculate it. You should spend around 30 minutes on this.

Sub-Task 3:
Prepare a half-page summary or slide of key findings and add some suggestions for data augmentation â€“ which other sources of data should the client provide you with and which open-source datasets might be useful

### Week 3 Task:
